  We made our API a little prettier in this last installment. We take semi-fluid
	strings as specifiers for how often something should be done. Often, though,
  it makes sense to only perform intensive tasks at specific times when there 
  is going to be less system load. On a Christian social networking site, this
  might be noon on Sundays (when everybody is in church). The idea is simple,
  and the implementation not much more difficult.

	We still are interested in calling our callback functions at regular intervals. 
	Which means that all that's changing here is that the initial action is offset
	from the time that we create the task. Now hold on a second while I blow your 
	fucking mind:
</p>
<pre>
function TimeInterval() {
	// Here, we are defining the offset as the number of seconds from 12:00 AM,
	// January 1st of an arbitrary year. The offset is something like the 
	// "origin" on a Cartesian graph.
	this.offset = 0;
	this.seconds = 0;
	this.addTo = function(ti) {
		this.seconds += ti.seconds;
		return this;
	};
}
</pre>
<p>
	That's right, bitches. One new field and a comment that takes up 3 times as 
	many lines.
